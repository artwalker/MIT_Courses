1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good morning.
OK.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The topic for today is Energy
and Power.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Most of the time this semester,
up to now at least,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we focused a lot on speed.
We have been truly speed freaks

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
looking at how fast can we
switch the signal,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
what does a time domain
waveform look like?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We also looked at frequency
responses of circuits.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This week we will spend on
something a little bit

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
different, and that relates to
energy and power.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Energy and power is gaining a
lot more importance in certainly

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
this decade, and will do so in
the future.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I am going to work out a
little example towards the end

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of the lecture.
And there you will see that if

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you do things naively,
your handheld devices,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
your cell phone,
laptops and so on will just up

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and explode.
You have got to be a little bit

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
careful in terms of how to
manage energy and power.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Before I get into that,
I just want to wrap up with a

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
quick review of what we covered
last week.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We ended last week by looking
at positive feedback in analog

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
circuits using an op amp.
And, in particular,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we built an oscillator.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We built an oscillator that
allowed us to charge a

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
capacitor.
And when the voltage across the

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
capacitor equaled that at the
minus terminal it would flip and

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
keep doing so.
And at the output you would get

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
a waveform that looked like
this.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You would get a square wave
output.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, throughout the course we
have talked about getting square

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
wave inputs.
And this is one example of how

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you can actually produce a
square wave pretty much from

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
first principles using a
capacitor, resistors and an op

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
amp.
Now, I just wanted to wrap up

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
this little item here by talking
about one application of an

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
oscillator.
And this application of the

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
oscillator really nicely closed
the loop on the body of

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
knowledge relating to digital
circuits that we have covered in

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
this course.
What I want to talk about

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
briefly is a small digital
system with a sender and a

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
receiver.
And the sender is sending a

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
signal, the receiver receives a
signal, and in this course we

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
have talked about senders
sending a sequence of ones and

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
zeros.
Say, for example,

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the sender wants to send some
sort of a signal like this.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have seen that this is quite
a legitimate signal.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We get some kind of oscillatory
behavior because of the

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
inductance and capacitance
associated with the wire.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And what you have done is that
you pretty much believed me when

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I said that this really
corresponds to a one,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
one, zero.
The sender wants to send a one,

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
one, zero signal to the
receiver, and the receiver gets

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
it.
So this is a one,

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
this is a one,
this is a zero.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But if I am a receiver,
I am going to look at the

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
square wave.
There is no such thing as

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
sending a one on a wire.
You cannot send a one on a

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
wire.
You send a voltage signal or a

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
current signal on a wire.
So, the receiver receives a

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
voltage signal.
It is going to be zero for some

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
time and then maybe 5 volts or 3
volts or whatever is your high

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and then zero again.
How does my receiver know it's

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
a one, one, zero?
Why can't it be a one,

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
one, one, one,
zero, zero, zero?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It doesn't know.
How does the receiver know it's

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
a one, one, zero sequence and
not 50 ones followed by 40

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
zeros?
It doesn't know.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What we need is --
For senders to be able to

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
communicate with receivers,
we need some kind of agreed

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
upon time when receivers sample
the signal coming in and decide

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
whether it's a one or a zero.
They both have to agree on

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
certain time bases when to look
at the input.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One way to deal with this is I
can have a clock,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
a square wave signal that we
call a clock in digital systems

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and ship it to the other side in
the following manner.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This clock signal can be
applied to this sender and to

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
this receiver.
For more details on this,

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
let me recommend Page 735 of
the course notes that talks

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
about a detailed example of the
use of a clock in a digital

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
system.
What I can do is create a clock

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that looks like the square wave.
The clock provides a notion of

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
time to the circuit.
And I have some kind of a clock

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
signal generator.
And I connect that to the

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
sender and connect that to the
receiver.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And now both the receiver and
the sender have a notion of

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
time.
And what I can do is I can tell

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
my receiver, the sender and the
receiver can have an agreement

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
between them that says that look
at the signal at your input when

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
on the rising edge of the clock.
Whenever the clock rises,

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
when you see a rising edge look
at the value in the wire and

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that's the value I sent.
By doing so,

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
what I can do is that the
receiver can look at the signal.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
At this rising edge it sees a
zero, this is vOH,

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
looks up here,
sees a one here,

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
sees a one here and sees a
zero.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, it correctly sampled one,
one, zero at the receiving end.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And the sender can send the
same sequence here once we have

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
this time base.
This little brief foray

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
circuits was simply to give you
an application of a circuit that

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
can produce a square wave.
I can create a clock with a

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
time base.
Also, interestingly much more

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
fundamental is we looked at
various abstractions throughout

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the course.
We talked about discretizing

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
space by looking at lumped
signals.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What I also want to point out
is that a clock can be viewed as

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
another fundamental abstraction
in the digital domain where what

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I am doing is discretizing time.
What I am saying is that,

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
look, in the digital domain we
have already discretized value

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
into zeros and ones,
but we still had continuous

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
time until now.
And what you do in digital

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
systems is to say that look,
let's digitize everything,

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
or rather discretize
everything.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And let's discretize time as
well into these points that

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
happen on the rising edge of the
clock which means that the

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
circuit has meaning,
signals have meaning only when

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the clock is rising.
That tends to discretize time

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
which means that I really don't
care what happens to signals in

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
this time, as long as on the
rising edge of the clock I get

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the right value.
This concept is called

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
discretizing time.
And a clock lets you do that.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Remember that in digital
systems, which you will learn

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
about in 004 I am really
discretizing two things,

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
discretizing values into zeros
and ones, and at the same time

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
also discretizing time into a
time when I sample things and a

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
time when I ignore values on the
wires.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I think you will get to clocks
in 6.004 after about a month,

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
so initially you would just be
focusing on the statics of the

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
system without worrying about
any dynamic clock introduced in

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the circuit.
OK, that's just a brief little

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
interlude.
With that let me get into

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
today's topic of energy and
power.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why is this important?
The reason this is important is

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that what really determines the
size of your handheld?

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You may think oh,
gee, electronics in the

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
handheld.
Some of you may think,

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
oh, the antenna in the
handheld.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No.
What really,

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
really determines the size and
weight of your handheld devices,

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
your PDAs, your cell phones,
your laptops and so on is by

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and large the battery.
On Page 2 I have a little

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
cartoon that shows you that if
we did not have you learn about

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
energy and power,
that's what we would all be

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
doing in order to use cell
phones.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not surprisingly the very first
wireless phones ended up in

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
automobiles because you had a
big battery.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And so you had these wireless
phones only in cars.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because of a huge amount of
research based on the knowledge,

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
the technologies I am going to
talk about in today's lecture

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and Thursday's lecture,
you will see very simple and

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
elegant ways of reducing the
amount of battery you need to be

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
able to get some kind of
function out of analog or

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
digital devices.
I also want you to take a look

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
at Page 2 of the handout that I
have given you here,

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
handout 63.
This handout talks about the

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
absolute latest in digital
fabrication technology out

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
there.
This is not a paid commercial

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
for IBM.
IBM has a technology called

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
CU08.
It is called Blue Logic.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It is called the Copper 08
Process.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And in this process,
if you look down on Page 1,

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for example,
IBM claims that it can build up

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to 72 million gates in a single
chip.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
With this technology they are
able to build 70 to 80 million

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
gates where a gate is,
unless otherwise mentioned,

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
pretty much defined as a two
input NAND gate equivalent.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, your inverter,
your NAND gate and so on count

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
as a gate.
And they can build close to 80

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
million of these little suckers
on a single chip.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Just imagine that.
And the biggest chip they can

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
build is on the order of 18 to
19 millimeters on a side,

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
roughly two centimeters on a
side.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
On a chip that's about one
square inch.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can put down 80 million
gates.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What is more important for
today is what is on Page 2,

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
actually.
I have circled two things on

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Page 2.
One thing that I have circled

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is power supply range in the 0.7
to 1.3 volts.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Notice that that voltage,
the power supply voltage for

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
these chips is significantly
lower than the 5 volts that we

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
have been normally talking about
in this course.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
When in doubt our problems have
used 5 volts.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But notice that in this
technology they're talking about

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
using voltages for the power
supply VS in the range of 0.7 to

183
00:00:01,300 --> 00:11:49,000
Why is it so much lower?

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, you will find out.
The second thing I've circled

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is something called power
dissipation.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And you say power dissipation
is said to be 0.006 microwatts

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
per megahertz per gate.
It says power dissipation is 6

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
nanowatts per megahertz per
gate.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What that says is that each
gate off your circuit will

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
dissipate this much power at a 1
megahertz frequency.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And the implication of that is
that you should be able to

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
convert that single number to
the power dissipation in any

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
chip that you might build
depending on the number of gates

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that you have,
the frequency you run the

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
circuit at, the voltage that you
use and so on and so forth.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
By the end of today's lecture
you will be able to take this

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
number and correlate that into
the power dissipation of any

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
chip that you might want to
build with this.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That just serves as the
motivation that by the end of

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
this lecture you will understand
how to very quickly in five

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
seconds or less,
boom, given a chip,

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
oh, yeah, that should consume
about 30 watts of power.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And what you will also do,
based on some examples here,

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
estimate the power of not the
Pentium IV but a chip following

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the Pentium VI,
let's call it the Pentium V

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
would consume if it ran at 1
gigahertz.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We will come up with some
absolutely shocking numbers

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
based on what you have learned.
With that kind of motivation

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
let me get into talking about
some theory and get into the

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
foundations of energy and power.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's go to Page 3.

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
To drive the theoretical
discussion, I would like to

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
focus on the energy dissipated
in a MOSFET gate.

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And fundamentally we will talk
about looking at energy and

215
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
power in circuits containing
switches, resistors and

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
capacitors.
The MOSFET gate is simply an

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
illustrative example to drive
the theory.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But fundamentally what I am
going to show you,

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or lead you through today,
I will tell you how to compute

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the power and energy when you
have capacitors,

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
resistors, voltage sources and
switches in your circuit.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We will look at a circuit that
looks like this.

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Your vanilla inverter circuit.

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My inverter.
I apply some vIN signal here.

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It could be a square wave.
It could be some sequence of

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
ones and zeros.
And this is an inverter that we

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
all know and love.
And this guy here is,

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
stuck in a capacitor here.
And this capacitor is meant to

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
model the input gate capacitance
of whatever this inverter drives

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
plus any capacitance of the wire
leading up to that gate and so

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
on.
It is just a lumped capacitor

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that I have stuck on there.
I am interested in determining

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
a few things.
One is what we call the standby

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
power.
You will see all these terms

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
being used in cell phones and so
on.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
In your cell phone,
your cell phone manufacturer

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
gives you two numbers.
Of course both are over

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
exaggerations,
but they give you two numbers

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
nonetheless.
One number is the number of

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
days that the cell phone battery
will last when in standby mode,

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
right?
That's exactly where standby

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
comes from.
In standby mode,

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
how much power does your cell
phone or how long will the

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
battery last,
that's the standby power.

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And the second thing is what we
call active use power.

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Active use is when you are
making a phone call and so on,

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
what is the power consumed?
And there again your

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
manufacturer of your cell phone
will give you a much smaller

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
number for the active use power
of your cell phone.

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What I am going to do is assume
for discussion that the inverter

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
is driven by a square wave
signal of the following sort.

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is vIN.
And I am going to drive this

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
with a signal of this sort.
The period applied at the

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
input, so I am switching the
inverter on and off,

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
on and off, on and off.
And T1 seconds for the high,

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
T2 seconds for the low.
This is the inverter,

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
this is the input signal,
and we'll keep coming back to

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that again and again.
Rather than directly taking

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
this circuit and analyzing its
power, I would like to do things

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
in a slightly roundabout manner.
What I would like to do is show

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you some very simple circuits
and analyze their standby and

262
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
active powers.
And then show you that this

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
circuit simply is a combination
of some of the simple things

264
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that you have seen.
Example 1.

265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I would like to take a simple
circuit that looks like this.

266
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A voltage source V applied
across a resistor R,

267
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
some current I.
And if I apply a voltage across

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
this resistor,
that voltage would simply

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
appear across the resistor.
And the power is simply given

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
by VI which is simply V squared
divided by R.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is 6.002 101 in the very
first chapter.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That is the power that is
dissipated by this resistor,

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
simply V squared divided by R.
That's the power dissipated by

274
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the resistor.
Where does that power come

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
from?
The voltage source supplies the

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
power.
So, this guy here supplies this

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
power and this guy here
dissipates it.

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What is the energy that I
dissipate in T time?

279
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Remember, power is the rate of
energy dissipation.

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And so energy is simply power
multiplied by time.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
For a circuit like this,
energy dissipated in time T is

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
simply VIT.
For our gate remember we have

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
two situations.
We have VS, we have RL we have

284
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
RON, vO and vIN.
So, vIN is high.

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If vIN is high with respect to
ground then RON,

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
the switch is on,
and this is the circuit that I

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
see.
In this situation the power

288
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
consumed is simply V squared
divided by the resistance here.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It is simply VS squared divided
by RL plus RON.

290
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me mark that with an
asterisk.

291
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I will refer to this later.
Similarly, when vIN is low the

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
MOSFET is off.
And the power is simply zero.

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I have no current flowing down
and the power is zero.

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Absolutely basic stuff.
Absolutely basic.

295
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, the power,
when I have the MOSFET on,

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
for the kind of inverters you
have seen so far,

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
this is the power consumed by
the inverter.

298
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And this asterisk here is
simply to say hold that thought,

299
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we will get back to it a little
later.

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let me work out a second
example.

301
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In this second example,
I would like to consider the

302
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
following circuit,
a voltage source VS with a

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
strange arrangement of switches,
S1 with a resistance R1,

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:02,000
a capacitor C in this manner,
a switch S2 and a resistor R2.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
For now don't worry about how
the circuit comes about.

306
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Just assume that I have drawn
the circuit for you.

307
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And what I want to do is
compute the power under certain

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
conditions.
Notice that if this is off and

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
this is off, there is no current
flowing either in this loop or

310
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
this loop, and the power
dissipated by the circuit is

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
zero.
But there are some arrangement

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
of switches for which I do
consume power.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And so let me show you that
arrangement of switches.

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And what I am going to do is
assume that the switches open

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and close with the following
periodic cycles.

316
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's assume that when this is
high S1 is closed and S2 is

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
open, and when this is low
assume that S1 is open,

318
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
S2 is closed.
And let's assume this is T,

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
this is T1, this is T2.
That sequence should be

320
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
reminiscent of this input that I
am feeding to this inverter.

321
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All I am telling you here is
that I am giving you the

322
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
circuit.
I want to compute the power

323
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
consumption of the circuit.
And what I am telling you is

324
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
that with the frequency,
with a time period of capital

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
T, for the first T1 seconds this
switch is closed and that is

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
open.
So, this circuit applies.

327
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In the second half of the clock
this switch is open so this

328
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
circuit applies.
And what I am interested in

329
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
finding out is what is the
energy dissipated in each cycle

330
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
of time capital T?
And I also want to find out the

331
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
average power.
Just spend about five seconds

332
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
just staring at this and kind of
intuit what is going on here.

333
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I start by putting a voltage
source here and I close the

334
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
switch.
That is open.

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Start by closing this,
what happens?

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
When I close the switch VS is
going to charge up this

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
capacitor.
I get current flowing through

338
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
my resistor, so I am going to be
charging up this capacitor here.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Then let's say I allow T1 to be
as large as possible,

340
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and so this capacitor is going
to be charged up to all of VS.

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
After a long time this guy gets
to be VS in the capacitor.

342
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And as it is charging up I have
current flow through the

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
resistor, so it is sitting there
dissipating power.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Notice that this sucker does
not dissipate energy.

345
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It simply stores energy.
So, the energy supplied by the

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
voltage source comes in,
some of it gets stored in the

347
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
capacitor and some of it is
being dissipated by the

348
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
resistor.
That gets me to the end of T1.

349
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
At the end of T2 I open the
switch and close this switch.

350
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
When I close the switch I have
some energy on the capacitor,

351
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and the voltage across the
capacitor begins to drive a

352
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
current through this resistor
R2.

353
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And now the capacitor supplies
its stored energy,

354
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and its stored energy then
begins to dissipate through

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
resistor R2.
And if T2 is very long then all

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the charge in the capacitor
drains out.

357
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And the voltage in the
capacitor at the end will be

358
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
zero.
So, that is just sort of a high

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
level description of what goes
on.

360
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Now let's go ahead and compute
from first principles the

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
energetics of this little
circuit.

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Let's look at the entire period
capital T, and as a first step

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
look at T1.
When T1 is in place S1 is

364
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
closed and S2 is open.
Accordingly,

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the circuit that applies looks
like this.

366
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I have VS, S1 is closed,
so that is closed,

367
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and I have this resistance R1,
I have this capacitance C,

368
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
some voltage VC across the
capacitor.

369
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You can go ahead and assume
that VC of zero is zero.

370
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That I start off my life with
no voltage across the capacitor.

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
First of all,
let me plot the waveforms and

372
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
write the expressions down and
then compute the energy supplied

373
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
by the voltage source and then
look at where the energy goes.

374
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You all know,
or should know by now,

375
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
if I plot VC as a function of
time, remember,

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
this is really easy to do.
VC as a function of time goes

377
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
like this.
At time T equal to zero I am

378
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
telling you that the capacitor
voltage is zero.

379
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I am telling you that.
So, it is at zero.

380
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And then the capacitor charges
up until it reaches VS.

381
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I also know that after a long
time this will be VS,

382
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
after a long time that will be
VS, and between those two I have

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a rising function that looks
like this.

384
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can similarly plot the
current for you.

385
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
At time T equal to zero
instantaneously the capacitor

386
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
looks like a short,
and so the current that I start

387
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
off with is going to be VS
divided by R1.

388
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The voltage across the
capacitor is zero.

389
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
All the voltage falls across
the resistor R1.

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So, VS divided by R1 is the
initial instantaneous current.

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And after a long time,
because VC reaches VS,

392
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
the current is going to be
zero.

393
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And between those two points I
get an exponential decay.

394
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I could very quickly write down
the expression for the current.

395
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And that is simply the initial
value VS divided by R1 times the

396
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
exponential decay minus T
divided by the time constant for

397
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the circuit R1C.
You have seen this stuff

398
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
before.
Here comes the part that we

399
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
care about for now.
Let's find out what is the

400
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
total energy provided by the
source.

401
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
When dealing with energy
computations you have to be

402
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
incredibly careful of these
words here, supply,

403
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
provided versus dissipated.
Dissipated implies that the

404
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
resistor is burning energy.
Provided means that the source

405
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
is supplying that energy.
So, energy provided by source

406
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
during T1.
Let's go ahead and compute that

407
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
very quickly.
The energy supplied by the

408
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
source is simply the voltage
across the source multiplied by

409
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the current being supplied by
the source.

410
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This is i.
Remember, by associated

411
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
variables convention,
if I have a voltage across some

412
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
element and the current into the
element is positive then that

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
element dissipates power.
If the voltage here is,

414
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
say, 1 volt and it is supplying
current, if the i is out in the

415
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
other direction then it is
supplying power.

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
In this case,
the current i is going to be on

417
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the outside, heading outside.
The total energy is going to be

418
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the instantaneous power
integrated over time,

419
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and that is simply VS.
Remember, the instantaneous

420
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
power is VS times the current i,
so the instantaneous power is

421
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
simply VS times i,
that is the instantaneous

422
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
power.
To get the energy provided by

423
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
source and some time,
I have to integrate that

424
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
instantaneous power over the
period of interest T1.

425
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That gives me the energy
supplied by the source during

426
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
T1.
And let me go ahead and

427
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
substitute for i with this
expression here.

428
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It is VS times i,
and i is VS divided by R1 times

429
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
this expression here.
That gives me

430
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
(VS^2/R1)e^(-t/R1C) dt.
Let me carry out the

431
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
integration there.
I get -1/RC,

432
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
so I get this outside.
And I also get to write down,

433
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
oops, let me do that a little
bit more carefully.

434
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
VS^2/R1 simply comes out and I
get a -R1C in the numerator.

435
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If I differentiate it then I
get R1C in the denominator.

436
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I have an integral that comes
up here.

437
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And then I write down e^-t/R1C,
zero and T1.

438
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, this R1 and this R1 cancel
out.

439
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And I end up getting something
that looks like this.

440
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I get CVS^2.
And so there is a minus sign

441
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
out here, so at zero this thing
goes to a one,

442
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
so I get a one.
And because of minus sign I get

443
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
e to the -T1/R1C.
All I have done here is simply

444
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
go through the math to do this
integration here.

445
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What I am also going to do is
assume that if T1,

446
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
if the time that the switch is
closed is much,

447
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
much bigger than the time
constant of the circuit,

448
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
T1 is much, much greater than
R1C, if this is much,

449
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
much greater than R1C then this
term goes to zero.

450
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And this becomes more or less
equal to CVS^2.

451
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What do we have here?
What we have here is that if I

452
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
let the switch stay closed for a
long time and S to be open then

453
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the voltage source is going to
supply some amount of energy.

454
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That energy will equal CVS^2.
The voltage across the

455
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
capacitor will be VS and all
that energy would have been

456
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
supplied by this guy.
Let me pose the following

457
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
conundrum here.
If the voltage across the

458
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
capacitor is VS,
because we know the energy

459
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
stored in the capacitor is half
CV^2.

460
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, the energy in the capacitor
is half CVS^2.

461
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
At the end of the day,
since the voltage across the

462
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
capacitor is VS,
ΩCV@2 is the energy stored

463
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
here.
But we know,

464
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
from this calculation,
the source has supplied CVS^2.

465
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Source has supplied twice that
energy.

466
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This guy has supplied twice
that energy and only half of

467
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that is stored here.
Who ate up the other half?

468
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The resistor,
exactly.

469
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The resistor has walloped half
the energy.

470
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Let me just show it to you.
It dissipated ΩCVS^2.

471
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's pretty interesting.
It's a pretty simple result.

472
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
If T1 is very large compared to
time constant then half the

473
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
energy is in the capacitor and
half of it has been burned by

474
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
R1.
This energy has not been

475
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
burned.
It is simply stored.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It is stored by the capacitor.

477
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And if you do simple energy
conservation arithmetic here,

478
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
the energy dissipated in the
resistor plus that stored in the

479
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
capacitor equals the energy
supplied by the source.

480
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
All right.
Let's go to T2 now.

481
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
At T2, S2 is closed and S1 is
open.

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Let's look at the second part
of the cycle when S1 is open and

483
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
S2 is closed.
And what is going to happen now

484
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is the left-hand part of the
circuit can be ignored and I can

485
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
focus on this part.
So, S2 is closed.

486
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This is RC, my capacitor,
this is vC.

487
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
This is the circuit of
interest.

488
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What is the initial condition
on this?

489
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What is the value of vC
initially?

490
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Start off, because remember,
I allowed this capacity to

491
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
charge up fully,
and so initially I have VS on

492
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
the capacitor.
And so the energy on the

493
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
capacitor initially is ΩCVS^2.
That is the energy on the

494
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
capacitor.
This time around I won't go

495
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
through an integration process
like that, but you can if you

496
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
like, and do it in a much
similar manner to say that now

497
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
let's suppose that T2 is much
greater than this time constant.

498
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If T2 is much greater than R2C,
this time constant.

499
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
If that time is much greater
than this entire,

500
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the initial voltage VS drives a
current through the resistor,

501
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and after some amount of time
the voltage across the capacitor

502
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
goes to zero and all the energy
in the capacitor gets dissipated

503
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in R.
So, if T2 is much greater than

504
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
R2C then energy dissipated in R2
is simply ΩCVS^2.

505
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Notice that the energy
dissipated in R1,

506
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in the first half cycle is
ΩCVS^2 and the second half cycle

507
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
during T2, if T2 is large
enough, all this energy gets

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
dissipated in this resistor R2.
And I have that expression

509
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
here.

510
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So let me just say that this is
E1 and let me say that this is

511
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
E2.
So, E1 is dissipated in the

512
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
resistor and E2 is dissipated in
R2 in the second half cycle.

513
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
A couple of interesting things
to note at this point.

514
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
One is that E1 and E2 are
independent of R.

515
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
If the time constant is small
enough compared to the time that

516
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I charge the capacitor then half
the energy gets lots in the

517
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
resistor, and that is simply
ΩCVS^2.

518
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And if I let this discharge
completely it doesn't matter

519
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
what resistor I am discharging
it through.

520
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's the intuition.
If I have certain energy here

521
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and I let it discharge
completely it doesn't matter

522
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
what this resistor is.
Small or large,

523
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it doesn't matter.
All this energy gets dissipated

524
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
there.
The rate at which the energy

525
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
gets dissipated will change
depending on R2.

526
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
If R2 is very small then I get
a burst of power initially and

527
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
then a rapid decay after that,
but if R2 is very large then I

528
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
have a much slower release of
energy.

529
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But suffice it to say that the
energy dissipated,

530
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the total energy in T2 is
simply ΩCVS^2.

531
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
All right.

532
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Let's put T1 and T2 together
and look at the total energy

533
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
dissipated --

534
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Total energy dissipated.
E is simply E1 plus E2.

535
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Dissipated in each cycle.
Assuming T1 and T2 are much

536
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
larger than the respective time
constants.

537
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And I know that this is ΩCVS^2,
ΩCVS^2, so this is simply

538
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
CVS^2.
If I have an arrangement of

539
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
switches and capacitors like
that, I charge the capacitor,

540
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
discharge the capacitor,
charge the capacitor,

541
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
discharge the capacitor.
What it is saying is that in a

542
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
charge/discharge cycle I am
using up CVS^2 of energy.

543
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
ΩCVS^2 when I charge it up and
ΩCVS^2 when I discharge it.

544
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That is what I get.
Let's compute the average power

545
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
dissipated, P average in a cycle
is simply E/T where T is the

546
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
period of the square wave
sequence that I have shown you

547
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
out there.
This is simply CVS^2 divided by

548
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
T.
If the period of the square

549
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
wave is capital T,
I can express that as a

550
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
frequency.
Let's say for example the

551
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
period of the square wave is T,
so let's say the frequency of

552
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the square wave is simply 1/T.
I can also express this as

553
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
C(VS^2)f.

554
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What does this say?
Let me mark that as a thing to

555
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
remember, the second thing to
remember.

556
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:00,000
One was the power that was the
static power.

557
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And second is this power
relating to this frequency f and

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the charging and discharging of
the capacitor in that little

559
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
circuit shown up there.
So, this average power is

560
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
CVS^2f.
What this is saying is that if

561
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
f is high, if I have high
frequency of charging and

562
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
discharging the capacitor then I
am charging and discharging much

563
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
more frequently so I am going to
consume more power.

564
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Notice that at any given time
there is no direct connection

565
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
between the power supply and the
ground.

566
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What I am doing is my capacitor
is an intermediary.

567
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I am dumping some charge in the
capacitor and the capacitor is

568
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
dumping the charge into ground.
It behaves like a switch to

569
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
capacitor.
And what it is doing is it is

570
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
being charged and discharged at
frequency f.

571
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So, it makes sense that the
amount of average current that I

572
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
am pumping through relates to
the frequency at which I am

573
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
charging and discharging the
capacitor.

574
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And similarly the average power
also relates to the value of the

575
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
capacitor.
If C is larger I dissipate more

576
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
energy.
And the same way with the

577
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
voltage.
If the voltage is higher then

578
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the power in that period,
or the average power relates to

579
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
CVS^2.
Spend a few seconds staring at

580
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
the two expressions.
This power here relating to

581
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
just this connection between the
power supply and ground and that

582
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
power out there relating to
charging and discharging

583
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
capacitors.
Let's get back to our inverter

584
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
right now.

585
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This is our inverter circuit.
Let us say that I drive the

586
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
input with the waveform shown
here.

587
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, I go back to the same
situation as here.

588
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I drive the input with a square
wave, with T1 and T2 as the high

589
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
time and the low time.
The equivalent circuit for this

590
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
is not exactly what we saw
there.

591
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The equivalent circuit for this
would look like this.

592
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I have a VS.
And the VS supply is connected

593
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
through RL, VS connected through
RL to a capacitor C.

594
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
This is my voltage vO.
So, VS is always connected to

595
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ground through this resistor and
capacitor in this manner.

596
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And then I have a resistor here
RON corresponding to that

597
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
MOSFET.
And there I am switching it on

598
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and off in a way that it is on
during T1 and off during T2.

599
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So, the situation here is a bit
different from that simple

600
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
situation I computed there.
Much like I computed the power

601
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
dissipation in that circuit,
I can go ahead and compute the

602
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
total power dissipated in this
circuit.

603
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I won't do it here.
The algebra tends to be a big

604
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
more grubbier than what I have
been through.

605
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And suffice it to say that you
can show that the average power

606
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
is given by
(VS^2)/(2(RL+RON))+(CVS^2)f

607
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
(RL^2)/(RL+RON)^2.

608
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OK?
And for details I suggest that

609
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you look at section 12.3 of the
course notes.

610
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Section 12.3 goes through the
algebra to compute the total

611
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
power dissipated by this
specific circuit,

612
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and here is the expression we
get.

613
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And let's take the specific
situation where RL is much

614
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
greater than RON.
If RL is much greater than RON

615
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
then I can ignore this RON here.

616
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And I get this.
And out here,

617
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
if I ignore RON,
then RL and RL will cancel out

618
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and I get CVS^2f.
If I ignore RON compared to RL

619
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
this is the expression I get.
Now you can see why I went

620
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
through those two examples.
This is exactly the power

621
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
consumed by the connection
between power supply and ground.

622
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And this CVS^2f is the power
consumed in charging and

623
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
discharging the capacitor.
If you look at the circuit here

624
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
it is consuming two kinds of
power.

625
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
One kind of power is due to the
current flowing directly from VS

626
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
through RL and RON to ground.
Oh, this also assumes,

627
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
by the way, that T1 is equal to
T2.

628
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So, in this circuit there are
two kinds of power.

629
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
One is the power when the
switch is on and I have a

630
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
current flowing from VS to RL to
ground.

631
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Notice I get an extra factor of
two in the denominator here.

632
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And that two comes about
because the connection to ground

633
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
only happens half the time.
It's half that power out there

634
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
because I am connected to ground
only when the switch is on.

635
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And that happens only half the
time, and so therefore I get the

636
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
VS^2/2RL.
And then CVS^2f is simply the

637
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
power that I consumed because I
am charging and discharging the

638
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
capacitor C.
Notice that in this inverter

639
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
circuit there are two kinds of
power.

640
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
One is called the standby power
which is static power being

641
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
consumed by the circuit,
and the second power is the

642
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
dynamic power because the
circuit is switching up and

643
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
down.
This relates to star and this

644
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
relates to the double star.
And to demonstrate that,

645
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I have a little demonstration
here that has an inverter.

646
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And I am going to up the
frequency of the square way of

647
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
driving the inverter.
I am going to show you a few

648
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
numbers so hang on for two
minutes after this demo.

649
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I will give you some numbers,
but I want you to go ahead and

650
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
compute the numbers based on
what we have seen here.

651
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And you will get suitably
impressed, I promise you.

652
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is the input fed to the
inverter.

653
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This is the output of the
inverter.

654
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Notice that the output of the
inverter reflects some sort of

655
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
an RC time constant because of
the output driving the

656
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
capacitor, and the same way
here.

657
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I start off by showing you that
on the left-hand side I am

658
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
simply measuring the power being
consumed by the circuit.

659
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Notice that the power being
consumed is expressed by the

660
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
needle being at this point here.
This is a very low frequency so

661
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
this is almost all standby power
consumed by the inverter.

662
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
The inverter is on half the
time, and when it is on it is

663
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
consuming power.
What I am going to now is

664
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
increase the frequency.
As I increase the frequency

665
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
driving the inverter what should
happen to this needle?

666
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
As I increase the frequency
there that waveform should

667
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
become closer and closer
together.

668
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And what should happen to the
needle?

669
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That should begin to go up.
If I increase the frequency it

670
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
should consume more and more
power and the needle should

671
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
start going up.
So, let me do that for you.

672
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
In terms of numbers there it is
on top of the four on the scale

673
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
in the middle.
I am going to increase the

674
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
frequency very slowly.
Unfortunately,

675
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the sampling scope messes up
the waveform.

676
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Ignore the waveform for now.
Just look at the meter as I

677
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
increase the frequency.

678
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Notice that I have increased
the frequency by about a factor

679
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
of 2 or 3.
And notice here that this meter

680
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
has moved.
The needle has moved to the

681
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
right.
And I can keep doing that and

682
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
the needle keeps moving to the
right as I am consuming more and

683
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
more power because I'm driving
the inverter faster and faster

684
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and faster.
That should convince you that

685
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
there is a standby power and
there is some power component

686
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
related to frequency.
This relates to your standby

687
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
power in your cell phone.
This relates to active use.

688
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Let me show you some numbers,
and you can plug those numbers

689
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
in yourself and see how much
power this converter is going to

690
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
consume and see if it makes
sense.

691
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Assume that I have a chip with
10^8 gates.

692
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
F is 1 gigahertz.
That is 10^9.

693
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Assume C is 0.1 femtofarads
which is 10^-16 farads.

694
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Assume VS is 5 volts.
Assume RL is 10 kilo ohms.

695
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Use these numbers.
Plug these numbers in here and

696
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:16,000
get a sense if our modern-day
circuitry used that inverter,

697
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:26,000
what would be the power
consumed by a chip that contains

698
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:35,000
10^8 of these gates?
You will find out that you may

699
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:45,000
have to use a nuclear power
reactor to actually drive that

700
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
chip, but go check it out for
yourselves.

701
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:03,000
In the next lecture we will see
then how do our cell phones

702
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
work, how does life go on
despite this horrendous

703
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
calculation here.
