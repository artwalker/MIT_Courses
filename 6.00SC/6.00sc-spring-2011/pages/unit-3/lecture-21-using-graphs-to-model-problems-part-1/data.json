  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture begins by finishing up k-means clustering. It then moves on to introduce the notion of modeling things using graphs (sets of nodes and edges that link them).\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 21: Using Graphs to Model Problems, Part 1 About this Video Topics covered: Pseudocode, graphs, nodes, edges, adjacency matrix, adjacency list.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Lecture slides (PDF) Check Yourself What are filters used for?\n› View/hide answer\nFilters allow us to choose which features to use for our classification, so that we are basing our inferences on the most relevant information (e.g. teeth instead of body size for dietary habits of mammals).\nWhat is a graph?\n› View/hide answer\nA set of objects called nodes (or vertices) connected by a set of edges (or arcs).\nWhat is a digraph?\n› View/hide answer\nA graph with unidirectional edges.\nWhat is a weighted graph?\n› View/hide answer\nA graph in which each edge has an associated weight.\nBased on the code in the handout, why is Graph a subclass of Digraph, rather than the other way around?\n› View/hide answer\nEdge has a source and destination, and is therefore unidirectional already. This makes it easier for us to treat the bidirectional case Graph (where there is an edge for each direction) as a special case of Digraph.\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
