  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture continues the discussion of curve fitting, emphasizing the interplay among theory, experimentation, and computation and addressing the problem of over-fitting. It then moves on to introduce the notion of an optimization problem, and illustrates it using the 0/1 knapsack problem.\nImage courtesy of kob42kob on Flickr.\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 18: Optimization Problems and Algorithms About this Video Topics covered: Modeling, optimization, greedy algorithms, 0-1 knapsack problem.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Lecture slides (PDF) Launcher data file (TXT) Check Yourself What does an optimization problem consist of?\n› View/hide answer\nAn optimization problem requires that an objective function be optimized, either by maximizing or minimizing the function. There may also be a set of constraints that must be accounted for.\nWhat is problem reduction?\n› View/hide answer\nTaking a problem with an unknown solution and reducing it to a problem or problems with known solutions.\nProblem Sets Problem Set 8: Simulating The Spread of Disease and Virus Population (Due) In this problem set, using Python and pylab you will design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.\nInstructions (PDF) Code Files (ZIP) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .py file and 1 .pyc file.) Solutions (ZIP) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .py file and 1 .pdf file.) Problem Set 9 (Assigned) Problem set 9 is assigned in this session. The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 20 More Clustering.\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
