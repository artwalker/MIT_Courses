  "title":"More Optimization and Clustering",
  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture continues to discuss optimization in the context of the knapsack problem, and talks about the difference between greedy approaches and optimal approaches. It then moves on to discuss supervised and unsupervised machine learning optimization problems. Most of the time is spent on clustering.\nImage courtesy of Squiggle on Flickr.\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 19: More Optimization and Clustering About this Video Topics covered: Knapsack problem, local and global optima, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, training error, clustering, linkage, feature vectors.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Lecture slides (PDF) Check Yourself What is machine learning?\n› View/hide answer\n\u0026ldquo;A scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data.\u0026rdquo; From Wikipedia.\nWhat is inductive inference?\n› View/hide answer\nThe observation of examples that represent incomplete information about some statistical phenomenon in order to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions.\nWhat is supervised learning?\n› View/hide answer\nLearning in which a label is associated with each example in a training set.\nWhat is unsupervised learning used for?\n› View/hide answer\nUncovering hidden regularities or detecting anomalies in data.\nWhat is clustering?\n› View/hide answer\nThe process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way.\nWhat is agglomerative clustering?\n› View/hide answer\nClustering that merges clusters iteratively.\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
