  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture is about how to use computation to help understand experimental data. It talks about using linear regression to fit a curve to data, and introduces the coefficient of determination as a measure of the tightness of a fit.\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 17: Curve Fitting About this Video Topics covered: Arrays, curve fitting, numpy, pylab, least squares fit, prediction.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Lecture slides (PDF) Lecture data files (ZIP) (This ZIP file contains: 3 .txt files.) Recitation Videos Recitation 7: Distributions, Monte Carlo, and Regressions About this Video Topics covered: Data distributions, mean, standard deviation, Monte Carlo simulations, Monty Hall problem, Riemann sum method, data regressions, r^2 (r-squared), coefficient of termination, scientific applications of programming.\nCheck Yourself What is an objective function?\n› View/hide answer\nOne that provides a quantitative assessment of how well the curve fits the data.\nWhat method of curve fitting is used by polyfit?\n› View/hide answer\nLinear regression.\nWhat does curve fitting do?\n› View/hide answer\nRelates an independent variable to an estimated value of a dependent variable.\nWhat is the coefficient of determination?\n› View/hide answer\nCoefficient of determination, R^2, is equal to 1 – (estimated error)/(variance of the actual data)\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
