  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture presents ways of ascertaining how dependable information extracted from samples is likely to be. It covers standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and standard error. It also shows how to use pylab to produce histograms.\nImage courtesy of Kevin Dooley on Flickr.\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 15: Statistical Thinking About this Video Topics covered: Variance, standard deviation, standard error.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Recitation Videos Recitation 6: Probability and Statistics About this Video Topics covered: Probability, statistics, Venn diagrams, distributions, standard deviation, Monte Carlo simulation, plotting graphs.\nCheck Yourself What does the standard deviation tell us?\n› View/hide answer\nIt is a distance which describes the range +/- from the mean containing a particular fraction of the values; it describes the shape of the bell curve.\nWhat is variance?\n› View/hide answer\nA measure of how much spread there is in the possible different outcomes.\nWhat is the coefficient of variation?\n› View/hide answer\nThe standard deviation divided by the mean. If it\u0026rsquo;s less than 1, the distribution is considered low-variance.\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
