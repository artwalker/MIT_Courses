  "content":"« Previous | Next »\nSession Overview This lecture completes the introduction of classes by showing a way to implement user-defined iterators. It then discusses simulation models, and illustrates some of the ideas underlying simulations modeling by simulating a random walk.\nImage courtesy of donovanbeeson on Flickr.\nSession Activities Lecture Videos Lecture 12: Introduction to Simulation and Random Walks About this Video Topics covered: Subclasses, inheritance, generator, analytic methods, simulation methods, simulations, models, random walk.\nResources Lecture code handout (PDF) Lecture code (PY) Check Yourself What is a generator?\n› View/hide answer\nA function that remembers the point in the function body where it last returned a value and the values of all local variables.\nWhat is the difference between yield and return?\n› View/hide answer\nWhen yield is used, the state of the function is not lost.\nWhat is a model?\n› View/hide answer\nA model is a theoretical construct that will provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled.\nProblem Sets Problem Set 5: RSS Feed Filter (Due) In problem set 5, you will build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet. Your program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user\u0026rsquo;s interests (for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted).\nInstructions (PDF) Code Files (ZIP) (This file contains 1 .txt file, 3 .pyc files, and 6 .py files.) Solutions (ZIP) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .py file.) Problem Set 6 (Assigned) Problem set 6 is assigned in this session. The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 14 Sampling and Monte Carlo Simulation.\n« Previous | Next »\n"}
