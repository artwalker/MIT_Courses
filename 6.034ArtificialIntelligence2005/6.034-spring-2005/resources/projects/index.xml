      <description>This assignment looks at problems drawn (but simplified) from real research or application problems. The assignment is to think very carefully about how you would solve one of these problems using the representations and algorithms covered in Chapters 2 and 3. It also covers topics such as instructions for the assignment, grading criteria, problem descriptions and sample solutions.</description>
